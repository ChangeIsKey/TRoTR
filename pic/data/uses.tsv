722_(Ephesians 5:25)	And-Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Love does not insist on its own way. There is no way for the husband to obey that without submitting to his wife.	4:57	0:200	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church

726_(Ephesians 5:25)	The Bible teaches, "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church" and "teach the young women to love their husbands". Love in marriage can be deeper and more selfless than in any other relationship. It is this type of love that Jesus expects of HIS followers.	20:73	0:268	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
727_(Ephesians 5:25)	Certainly not "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." if you truly love your wide you won't beat her. To sum up the bible doesn't support any form of violence in marriage	15:68	0:215	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
728_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; the Gospel was not meant merely to reside in our intellect, memories, and tongues but to be seen in our lives.	0:53	0:190	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
729_(Ephesians 5:25)	Always missing from these models of the "ideal" marriage: the rest of Ephesians 5:25 "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it." Funny how the wife is supposed to do all the work, when the standard for the man was total sacrifice.	85:138	0:268	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
730_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. Husbands are called to serve their wives and family. Men, time to start making them sammiches.	0:53	0:177	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
731_(Ephesians 5:25)	SERVE AND HONOR YOUR SPOUSE. In Ephesians 5:25-28, it says"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. In the same way, husbands should love their wives as thier own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself." When we serve and honour our spouse, we demonstrate the sacrificial love of Christ and show them the value they have in our lives.	59:112	0:381	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
732_(Ephesians 5:25)	Ooga Booga I hope people aren't using the Bible to justify abuse. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church. Seek the highest good for her and surround her with a caring, unselfish love	66:119	0:197	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
733_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing[a] her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.	0:53	0:393	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
734_(Ephesians 5:25)	Disagree with you here. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 tells us exactly what love truly is. A husband who is patient, kind, and humble will be attentive to his wife's needs.	24:77	0:246	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
735_(Ephesians 5:25)	The Bible also tells husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, meaning to be willing to die for them. These passages aren't just about wives' submission, but also husbands' sacrificial love.	21:74	0:203	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
736_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; I see how you tried to substitute the word/idea of "love" with "serve". Love is much more than just service. Love is protection. Love is provision. Love is guidance. Love is leadership. Love is sacrifice. In order for relationships to work, they need to be patterned after how YAH purposed them to function. If husbands are called to love and cover their wives like Christ loved the church, then wives need to do their part.	0:53	0:504	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
737_(Ephesians 5:25)	In my tweet I was paraphrasing about Jesus if I ever quote a scripture I'll actually use the words quoted.

739_(Ephesians 5:25)	Not just that, Ephesians 5:25 says, "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it." Any husband who really loves his wife the way Paul commanded him to under inspiration of the Holy Spirit (2 Tim 3:16), he would be willing to die for her.	37:90	0:272	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
740_(Ephesians 5:25)	IS IT POSSIBLE FOR HUSBANDS LOVE HIS WIVES AS CHRIST LOVED THE CHURCH AND GAVE HIMSELF UP FOR THE CHURCH, THAT HE MIGHT SANCTIFY HER? LOVE YOUR WIFE IS A COMMAND AND NOT A CHOICE.	19:69	0:179	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
741_(Ephesians 5:25)	"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church". The word love here is Agapao. From my understanding and research this is the love of will, which eclipses all other loves, the type that by its nature is selfless and sacrificial. That is marriage	1:54	0:253	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
742_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church(He died for her). That's the ultimate model of self-sacrificial love. The husband denies himself to ensure the best for his wife. She submits to his loving authority in return.	0:53	0:230	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
743_(Ephesians 5:25)	"husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her" - I love that my husband of 43 years loves me like that üíï I'm not a doormat üòÄ	1:54	0:161	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
744_(Ephesians 5:25)	Ephesians 5:25 is the key to you getting the respect and honor you want from your woman. "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her". Christ refers to the church as his BRIDE. He SACRIFICED his life for his bride (the church). This is the standard.	90:143	0:285	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
745_(Ephesians 5:25)	"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her" So I'm the context of marriage the matter of love does not really conceren woman but it is the define assignment of A man to love his wife unconditionally.	1:54	0:239	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
746_(Ephesians 5:25)	the Bible says in Ephesians 5:25 reads, "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." Your unconditional acceptance of your wife is not based upon her performance, but on her worth as God's gift to you	41:94	0:240	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
747_(Ephesians 5:25)	"Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself for it" You cannot truly love your wife if you are stepping out of your marriage. Also, Jesus would be very against your teaching.	1:54	0:202	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
748_(Ephesians 5:25)	For the record, that guy isn't speaking for me. I've been married for many decades and counseled many couples. This is the standard:Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; Forcing a spouse to bed isn't Biblical.	132:185	0:251	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
749_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church, and gave himself for it; Marry a guy that will literally die for you the way Jesus died. If he's not loving you in the sacrificial way that Jesus Christ sacrificed for us all, he is not the one.	0:53	0:249	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
750_(Ephesians 5:25)	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. Husbands are to have sacrificial love for their wives, so, it's not misogyny.	0:53	0:160	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
751_(Ephesians 5:25)	Reason why men are mostly the first to say the word I LOVE YOU. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her; So this means, men are programmed to love at first, even if is for real or deceitfully.	64:117	0:234	Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church
1140_(Exodus 20:3)	The Bible is clear in its teachings that worship is to be directed solely towards God. Exodus 20:3-5a states, You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a carved image	110:148	0:196	You shall have no other gods before me
1141_(Exodus 20:3)	1. You shall have no other gods before Me; 2. You shall not make idols; 3. You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; 4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy; 5. Honor your father and your mother.	3:41	0:216	You shall have no other gods before me

1144_(Exodus 20:3)	Even the Bible says there's more than one. 1st Commandment "You shall have no other Gods before me". It doesn't say to recognize I am the only God or the one true god, but that I am the most important god.	60:98	0:205	You shall have no other gods before me
1145_(Exodus 20:3)	Exodus 20:3 - God says: You shall have no other gods before Me. üò© üòä	24:62	0:67	You shall have no other gods before me
1146_(Exodus 20:3)	Your idea that it doesn't 'hurt' God to worship un-real entities, also, can be dismissed because of the very first of the 10 commandments. You shall have no other gods before Me. Why? If it doesn't offend Him, why would he give such an order?	139:177	0:242	You shall have no other gods before me
1147_(Exodus 20:3)	The Unknown God: God‚Äôs First Commandment is, "You shall have no other gods before Me." Yet many today do not clearly understand who and what God really is.	46:84	0:155	You shall have no other gods before me
1148_(Exodus 20:3)	Christians have 10 commandments: 1. You shall have no other gods before me; 2. You shall not make for yourself an idol or worship any other gods; 3. ... . I truly believe that Christianity has taken a different direction due to the influence of other people's beliefs and how it's portrayed. What I mean is that some people have interpreted it in their own way, like the LGBTQ+ movement, which has complicated matters.	36:74	0:418	You shall have no other gods before me
1149_(Exodus 20:3)	The Lord said, you shall have no other Gods before me. I'm seeing far too many Christians treat their race as divine.	15:53	0:117	You shall have no other gods before me
1150_(Exodus 20:3)	1. You shall have no other Gods before me. Okay, so which god are you telling the Jewish, Muslim, Atheist, and Hindu kids they have to worship?	3:41	0:143	You shall have no other gods before me
1151_(Exodus 20:3)	Does this judge also refuse to perform marriages for people of different religions other than Christianity, since one of the Ten Commandments is "you shall have no other gods before me"? Or is she cherry-picking? Homosexuality didn't even make the Biblical top 10 list of sins.	146:184	0:277	You shall have no other gods before me
1152_(Exodus 20:3)	How many people will not go to haven because these two commandments? "You shall have no other gods before me".	70:108	0:110	You shall have no other gods before me
1153_(Exodus 20:3)	That's the thing...Not even God says he's the only god. He says "you shall have no other gods before Me," He wiped the worshippers of Muloch(?) for human sacrifice from the earth. He is the head honcho. The big kahuna. The "King of kings," Reading is hard, I know. Hehheh.	65:103	0:272	You shall have no other gods before me
1154_(Exodus 20:3)	RULE #1: You shall have no other Gods before me. Jesus - Hold my wine. What could possibly go wrong?	9:47	0:100	You shall have no other gods before me
1155_(Exodus 20:3)	The Commandments can be found a.o. in Exodus 20 in the Bible. I have seen them listed in various order. For the sake of clarity, let me reproduce them as found on the Hope and Truth website. 1. You shall have no other Gods before Me.	194:232	0:233	You shall have no other gods before me
1156_(Exodus 20:3)	With your understanding of God, and God‚Äôs commandment that you shall have no other gods before me, and your claim that God is unchanging, why was it not a sin for the disciples to worship Jesus at the end of Matthew?	59:97	0:216	You shall have no other gods before me
1157_(Exodus 20:3)	Exodus 20 3 states... "You shall have no other gods before me." That acknowledges the existence of other gods. There are other places in the bible where it says similar.	23:61	0:169	You shall have no other gods before me
