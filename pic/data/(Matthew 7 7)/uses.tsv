226_(Matthew 7:7)	Wow, sounds like a serious attempt. :) He is still patiently waiting for his child to call out to Him anyway. "Seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened, ask and it shall be given." A sincere question from a sincere heart will open a realm you didn't know existed. Kinda like Neo in the Matrix. God wants you to wake up, but He will NEVER force you. I always challenge everyone who asumes in their own way that God is not real. Just ask Him. Really ask Him, God, if your are there, reveal yourself to me. It normally is not instantaneous, but its always MIND BLOWING.	111:133	0:583	Seek and you will find
