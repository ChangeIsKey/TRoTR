      <h2 id="introduction.">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Your task is to rate the degree of semantic relatedness between two contexts in which a quotation is used. For instance, presented with a sentence pair as in <a href="#ex:1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ex:1">(1)</a>, you are asked to rate the semantic relatedness between the two contexts of <em>(John 15:13)</em> in <a href="#ex:1a" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ex:1a">(1a)</a> and <a href="#ex:1b" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="ex:1b">(1b)</a>.</p>

      <p><span id="ex:1" label="ex:1">(1)</span> - <b>quotation:</b> (John 15:13)</p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li><p><span id="ex:1a" label="ex:1a"></span>At a large Crimean event today Putin quoted the Bible to defend the special military operation in Ukraine which has killed thousands and displaced millions. His words <strong>Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends</strong>. And people were cheering him. Madness!!!</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="ex:1b" label="ex:1b"></span> It's the wonderful pride month!! Honestly pride is everyday! Love is love don't forget I love you Remember this!: My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. <strong>Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends</strong>.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="preparation.">Preparation</h2>
      <p>After registering on DUREL, you must complete the tutorial. Once you have passed the tutorial, you can annotate existing projects or upload your own project. The judgment in the tutorial work analogously to the later annotations.</p>
      <h2 id="task-structure.">Task structure</h2>
      <p>In regular annotation, you select the quotation for which you want to annotate sentences in the main menu. By clicking the 'Start annotation' button, you will get two sentences displayed next to each other, as you can see in <a href="#row:2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="row:2">Example A</a>. The target quotation is marked in bold in the respective sentence. Your task is to evaluate, for each of these pairs of sentences, how strong the semantic relatedness is between the two contexts of the target quotation in the two sentences.</p>
      <p>Because language is often ambiguous, it is important that you first read each sentence in a sentence pair individually and decide on the most plausible meaning of the target word BEFORE comparing the two uses of the word. In some cases, the sentences already provide enough information to understand the meaning of the target word; however, for cases that are unclear, you can find additional context beyond that in gray.</p>
      <h2 id="the-judgment-scale.">The judgment scale</h2>
      <p>The scale that you will be using for your judgment ranges from 1 (the two uses of the word have completely unrelated meanings) to 4 (the two uses of the word have identical meanings). This four-point scale is shown in <a href="#tab:scale" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="tab:scale">Table 1</a>.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Please try to ignore differences between the uses that do not impact their contexts For example, <em>Love is patient, love is kind</em> and <em>Love is patient and kind</em> can express the same context, even though one is from The Bible - Christian Standard Bible (2017), and the other is from The Bible - English Standard Version (2001).</p>
      <p>Note that there are no right or wrong answers in this task, so please provide your subjective opinion. However, please try to be consistent in your judgment.</p>

      <p>
        We now consider some evaluation examples to illustrate the different degrees of semantic relatedness you might encounter in annotation. Please note, as mentioned above, that these are only examples, and you should always give your subjective opinion.<br>
        The two instances of <em>So do not fear, for I am with you - (Isaiah 41:10)</em> in <a href="#row:2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="row:2">Example A</a> are judged identical in context (rating: 4), because both uses refer to the reliance on a higher power for strength and support during challenging times.<br>
        In contrast, the two uses of <em>The lord is my shepherd - (Psalm 23:1)</em> in <a href="#row:3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="row:3">Example B</a> are judged closely related but not identical (rating: 3), because their subsequent phrases diverge in terms of the specific desires expressed (financial vs. academic).

      <p>In <a href="#row:4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="row:4">Example C</a>, the two uses of the quotation <em>For everything there is a season - (Ecclesiastes 3:1)</em> are related, but more distantly (rating: 2). Unlike the <em>(Psalm 23:1)</em> example above, the two uses of <em>(Ecclesiastes 3:1)</em> in this example have different emphasis on the topic of time. The first sentence focuses on the concept of balance between work and rest; the second focuses on being concerned.</p>

        <p>Finally, you have the option to annotate ”Can't decide”. Please use this option only if absolutely necessary, i.e., if you cannot make a decision about the degree of semantic relatedness between the two uses of a quotation marked in bold. This may be the case, for example, if you find a sentence too flawed to understand, the use of the target quotation is ambiguous.</p>
        <h2 id="historical-language-data.">Social media data</h2>
        <p>The sentences provided for the annotation task were gathered from social media like Twitter and Reddit. Sentences may occur more than once in the table.</p>
        <p>The sentences may be very short or very long and some may seem ungrammatical. Also, words may be spelled in a different way than you are used to.</p>
        <p>Try to ignore these issues; focus only on the context of the target quotation. If you cannot decide, please provide a comment.</p>
