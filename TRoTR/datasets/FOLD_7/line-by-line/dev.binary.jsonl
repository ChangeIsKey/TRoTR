Oh, how much better the world would be if everyone followed this! We should all love one another and put others ahead of ourselves. This life isn't all about us, but it's about the way we treat others, including those we don't always agree with. It's about sharing a smile or a kind word to someone having a bad day, being ready to listen when someone wants to pour their heart out to you, and showing kindness to everyone you come across, even if they are unkind to you. The way you treat others says a lot about you. So treat others with the same love, compassion, and generosity you would want to be treated with. Let's all do this, and make the world a better place. :)","indices_target_token":"0:41","indices_target_sentence":"0:716","label_set":"1,2,3,4","non_label":"-","dataIDs":"463_(Romans 12:10)-c2,457_(Romans 12:10)-c1"}
