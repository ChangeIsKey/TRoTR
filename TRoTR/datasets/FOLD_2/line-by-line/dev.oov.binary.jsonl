'Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see'Faith! Wind moves the tree branches and you can feel a breeze on your face, but do you see the wind? It is the same with the Holy Spirit. You do not see the Spirit with human eyes, but can experience His presence and see His work in human lives: renewing minds, changing hearts, leading and guiding. Only hardened hearts and unenlightened souls think Jesus has failed the world. Jesus doesn't value women less than men. He actually restored earlier lost traditions of treating women as equals. One of His closest followers was a woman - Mary Magdalene - and she was the first person to whom He revealed His resurrected risen self.
