Open rebuke is often necessary. No amount of smart-talk will change that. If your concern is to be well-pleasing to God, you will not shield yourself from the truth by pretending rebuke was wrong because it hurt your ego. Ask yourself these. 1. Is the person saying the truth? 2. If my pastor or someone in my clique said this exact same thing, how would I react? These questions will give you clarity. Because many times, the offense you're picking up from a tweet is not the person being proud or nasty. It's your own bias distorting the person's message or \"tone\" in your mind. It's the person you're are ratioing because you don't like them. It's not what they said you're ratioing. Finally, when you get that righteous indignation stirring up in your chest to openly rebuke those who are openly rebuking others... Remember you're doing what you're correcting them for doing. So you're a hypocrite.","indices_target_token":"0:38","indices_target_sentence":"0:942","label_set":"1,2,3,4","non_label":"-","dataIDs":"130_(Proverbs 27:5)-c2,134_(Proverbs 27:5)-c2"}
