There is a significant difference between truth and facts - I am talking about the truth as revealed in the person of Jesus Christ and written in the scriptures. Facts are information presented as reality, but they may not be from scripture: biblical truth is eternal, but facts are temporal; biblical truth is absolute, but facts are changing; biblical truth is always true, but facts may not be true. As a believer in Jesus, biblical truth will change your life and set you free.","indices_target_token":"29:56","indices_target_sentence":"0:539","label_set":"1,2,3,4","non_label":"-","dataIDs":"626_(John 8:32)-c1,620_(John 8:32)-c2"}

Open rebuke is often necessary. No amount of smart-talk will change that.

Because many times, the offense you're picking up from a tweet is not the person being proud or nasty. It's your own bias distorting the person's message or \"tone\" in your mind. It's the person you're are ratioing because you don't like them. It's not what they said you're ratioing.

Is the person saying the truth? 2. If my pastor or someone in my clique said this exact same thing, how would I react? These questions will give you clarity. Because many times, the offense you're picking up from a tweet is not the person being proud or nasty. It's your own bias distorting the person's message or \"tone\" in your mind. It's the person you're are ratioing because you don't like them. It's not what they said you're ratioing.
