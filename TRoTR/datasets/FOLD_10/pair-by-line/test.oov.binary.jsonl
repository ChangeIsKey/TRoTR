Open rebuke is often necessary. No amount of smart-talk will change that.

Is the person saying the truth? 2. If my pastor or someone in my clique said this exact same thing, how would I react? These questions will give you clarity. Because many times, the offense you're picking up from a tweet is not the person being proud or nasty. It's your own bias distorting the person's message or \"tone\" in your mind. It's the person you're are ratioing because you don't like them. It's not what they said you're ratioing.

Is the person saying the truth? 2. If my pastor or someone in my clique said this exact same thing, how would I react? These questions will give you clarity. Because many times, the offense you're picking up from a tweet is not the person being proud or nasty. It's your own bias distorting the person's message or \"tone\" in your mind. It's the person you're are ratioing because you don't like them. It's not what they said you're ratioing.
