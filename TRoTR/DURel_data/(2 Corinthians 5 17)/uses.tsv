TTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come				514_(2 Corinthians 5:17)-c2		Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. Those who live in spiritual light have a renewed character. Now, when we sin, we cannot rest. We cannot just forget our sin, but immediately we repent and turn from that sin and receive the Lord's forgiveness.	0:106	0:317
